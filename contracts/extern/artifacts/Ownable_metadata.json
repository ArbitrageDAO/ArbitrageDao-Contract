			"notice": "Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to specific functions. The `owner` is first set by passing the address of the `initialOwner` to the Ownable constructor. The owner account can be transferred through a two steps process:      1. The current `owner` calls {transferOwnership} to set a `pendingOwner`      2. The `pendingOwner` calls {claimOwnership} to accept the ownership transfer This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to the owner.",
